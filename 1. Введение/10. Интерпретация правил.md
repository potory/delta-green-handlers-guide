An Example of Play

Amber is playing FBI Special Agent Cornwell. Tabitha is playing Dr. Palmer, an anthropology professor who advises the FBI on unusual cases. Cornwell and Palmer belong to Delta Green, which sends them to investigate suspected incursions of terrifying, unnatural forces—and to cover the incursions up to protect everyone else from awful dangers. 

Cornwell and Palmer have been seeking the hideout of a cult that seems to have ties to unnatural, inhuman forces. They figured out that it was someplace downtown. Then they heard on a police scanner that two cops were going to a derelict, downtown tenement after a complaint of screams and weird noises. The Agents drove over there fast and went inside. The Handler describes what they find.

HANDLER: “It’s all run-down and water-damaged. It stinks of mold. It’s very quiet and dark.”

TABITHA: “I’m looking for anything strange.”

HANDLER: “Things are quiet and under control right now, so you don’t need to roll for that. Your Search skill is at least 40%, right? In the second tenement, you find especially weird graffiti.”

TABITHA: “Weird, how? I have Anthropology at 70% and Occult at 80%.”

HANDLER: “It’s pictorial, almost like a cave painting but with spray-paint. You recognize human figures inside a blocky shape. Maybe a building. They’re dancing around some crazy black form. It’s drawn like the artist was having a seizure.”

AMBER: “I keep going. We need to find the cops.”

HANDLER: “Further in, the air starts to smell worse. Like blood and sewage. Do you keep looking?”

TABITHA: “We should leave.”

AMBER: “No! Where are the damn cops?”

HANDLER: “You find them two doors down, in a living room where the floor has caved in. One is on his stomach, covered in blood. You think he’s breathing. The other is…everywhere. It’s like she exploded. Make a Sanity roll. If you fail, lose 1D6 Sanity Points.”

AMBER: “Jesus. No kidding. I have 60 SAN and I rolled…48. Success. OK, I yell out, ‘Palmer!’”

TABITHA: “Fine. I run over. Don’t ask me why.”
